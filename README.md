# Lithium-Ion-Battery-Gradient-Boosting-Trees-

GBT is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision tree. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function. The model had a maximum depth(max_depth) of ‘2’, number of trees(n_estimators) of ‘20’ with a learning rate of ‘0.1’.(Among other various learning rates used)
